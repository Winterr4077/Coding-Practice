## 🧪 Project: Multi-Page Personal Site

In this lab, you will build a small personal website using **three connected HTML pages** and shared CSS styling. Each page will focus on a different section: Home, Projects, and Contact.

---

### 📁 Pages to Create

- `index.html` (Home)
- `projects.html` (Projects)
- `contact.html` (Contact)
- `styles.css` (shared across all pages)

---

### User Stories (for each HTML page):

- Use a proper DOCTYPE and `<html lang="en">`

- Include in `<head>`:
  - `<meta charset="utf-8">`
  - A relevant `<title>`
  - A linked `styles.css`

- Add a `<header>` with:
  - An `<h1>` for the page title
  - A `<nav>` with links to the **other two pages**

- Add a `<main>` section with content based on the page:
  - **Home page (`index.html`)**: intro paragraph and a list of your interests
  - **Projects page (`projects.html`)**: at least two projects using `<div class="project">`, each with:
    - `<h2>` title
    - `<p>` description
    - A placeholder `<a>` link
  - **Contact page (`contact.html`)**: a short message and a list of contact methods

- Add a `<footer>` with a short line like “Built by Winterr 2025”

---

### In `styles.css`:

- Apply a background colour and font for the whole site

- Use `max-width` and `margin: auto` to centre the content

- Add spacing between sections (headers, main, footer)

- Style the `<nav>` links with spacing and hover effects

- Style `.project` boxes with:
  - Background colour
  - Padding and margin
  - Text-align: left

- Optional: Make the nav stay consistent across pages

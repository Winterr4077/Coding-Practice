## 🧪 Project: Author Profile Card

In this lab, you will build an Author Profile Card using HTML and CSS. The layout should look polished, readable, and visually balanced — like a real-world personal branding component.

---

### User Stories:

- You should have a DOCTYPE declaration.

- You should have an html element with lang set to en.

- You should have a head element with:
  - A meta charset of utf-8
  - A title like “Author Card”
  - A linked external stylesheet (`styles.css`)

- You should have a main element with one `<div class="author-card">` containing:
  - An `<img>` of the author with alt text
  - An `<h1>` with the author’s name
  - A `<p class="bio">` with a short professional bio
  - A `<p class="email">` with a mailto link
  - A `<p class="location">` with a location or timezone
  - A `<footer>` inside the card with a copyright line

### 🎨 Colour Scheme (Professional & Neutral)

- **Background:** `#f4f4f9` (very light grey with slight warmth)
- **Card background:** `#ffffff` (pure white)
- **Text (default):** `#1a1a1a` (nearly black)
- **Accent (links or highlights):** `#0066cc` (modern blue)
- **Muted text (location, email):** `#666666`
- **Border (card outline):** `#dddddd`

---

### In your styles.css:

- Set `body` background to `#f4f4f9` and use a clean font like `"Segoe UI", sans-serif`

- Centre the card using `margin: auto`, add `max-width: 400px`, and set `padding: 20px`

- Add a `1px solid #dddddd` border and slight `border-radius: 6px` to `.author-card`

- Style the image to be a circle with `border-radius: 50%` and `max-width: 120px`

- Use `text-align: center` for layout balance

- Style `.bio` as `font-size: 15px`, `color: #1a1a1a`, `line-height: 1.6`

- Style `.email` and `.location` with `color: #666666` and smaller font

- Links should be blue (`#0066cc`), and use `:hover` to darken slightly

- Footer text should be muted and smaller (`font-size: 12px`, `color: #999999`)

When it’s done, I’ll mark ✅ or ❌. If anything’s off — spacing, contrast, structure — I’ll have you redo it until it's designer-grade.

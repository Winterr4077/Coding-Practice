## 🎨 CSS Challenge: Stylised Quote Block

In this challenge, you’ll style a `<blockquote>` element to make it stand out as a visual highlight on the page.

---

### 🎯 Objectives:

Style a blockquote so it:
- Has a **different background colour** from the page
- Uses a **left border** to create emphasis (like a pull quote)
- Has **padding inside the block** for breathing room
- Uses **larger or italicised text**
- Adds space around it using **margin**
- Is **responsive** — it shouldn’t overflow smaller screens

---

### ✅ What You Should Target:

```html
<blockquote class="quote">
  Good things take time, better things take a little longer.”
</blockquote>
```

### 💡 Bonus Ideas (Optional):
- Add `max-width` and centre it using `margin: auto`
- Use `text-align: center` or left-align depending on your aesthetic
- Style a `cite` tag underneath if included later

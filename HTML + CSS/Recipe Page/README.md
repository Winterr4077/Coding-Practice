## 🧪 Project: Recipe Page

In this lab, you’ll build a simple Recipe Page using only the HTML and CSS features you've covered in your lectures. Focus on clean structure, readable text, and visually separated content blocks.

---

### User Stories:

- You should have a DOCTYPE declaration.

- You should have an html element with lang set to en.

- You should have a head element with:
  - A meta charset of utf-8
  - A title like “Recipe Page”
  - A linked external stylesheet (`styles.css`)

- You should have a header containing:
  - An `<h1>` with the recipe title
  - A short intro paragraph

- You should have a main element with:
  - A section for **ingredients**
    - Use an `<h2>` for the heading
    - A `<ul>` with at least 5 list items

  - A section for **instructions**
    - Use an `<h2>` for the heading
    - An `<ol>` with at least 4 steps

  - A section for **image + tip**
    - A relevant `<img>` with alt text
    - A short tip paragraph styled differently with a class like `.tip`

- You should have a footer with a short line like “Recipe by Winterr” or “Last baked: 2025”

### In your styles.css:

- Set a background colour for the page

- Use `max-width` and `margin: auto` to centre the main content

- Add spacing (margin or padding) between each section

- Style headings (`h1`, `h2`) with distinct sizes or colours

- Make the `.tip` class styled differently (e.g. italics, muted colour, or border-left)

- Make the image smaller and centred using `display: block; margin: auto;`

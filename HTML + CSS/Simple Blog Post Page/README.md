In this lab, you will create a Simple Blog Post Page and style it using basic CSS. You’ll practise typography, spacing, colours, and layout control using things you’ve already worked with.

User Stories:

- You should have a DOCTYPE declaration.
- You should have an html element with lang set to en.

- You should have a head element with:
A meta charset of utf-8
A title of your choice (e.g., My Blog Post)
A linked external stylesheet (styles.css)

- You should have a header with:
An h1 element with the blog title
A short paragraph describing what the blog is about

- You should have a main element with:
An h2 with the post title
A paragraph or two of body text
An image with alt text
A link that says “Read more” or “View source”

- You should have a footer with a simple line like “Posted by Winterr” or the date.

In your styles.css:

Change the background colour of the page
- Centre the blog content using a max-width and margin: auto
- Style the headings (font-size, colour)
- Add spacing between sections using margin/padding
- Style the link with :hover and :visited

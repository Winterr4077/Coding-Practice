## 📚 About This Repository just push anything

This repository contains front-end practice projects created as part of my self-guided learning using HTML and CSS. Each project is built from scratch based on structured prompts and user stories from freecodecamp.org.

## 🧠 How Projects Are Generated (README.md's)

Each project is generated using a learning assistant (ChatGPT) with the following approach:

- I request a project brief using a clean, bullet-pointed format.
- The brief includes a project title, a description, specific user stories (requirements), and CSS styling goals.
- I write all code myself in Visual Studio Code.
- Once the project is complete, I upload the files for review.

## ✅ How Code Reviews Work

- My code is reviewed by ChatGPT (GPT-4), which checks for:
  - Semantic HTML structure
  - Proper use of tags and CSS
  - Alignment with the original brief
  - Clean, readable formatting

- Feedback is strict — if something doesn't meet the spec, I’m told to fix it and re-upload. This ensures I learn through correction, not shortcuts.

- I only move on to the next project once I’ve met **100% of the requirements**.
